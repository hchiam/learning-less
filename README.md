# Learning [Less CSS / Less.js](https://lesscss.org)

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

Less is conceptually similar to [SASS/SCSS](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-sass).

## Preprocessed

```sh
npm install -g less # or yarn global add less
lessc input.less output.css
# lessc, not just less
```

## Live, in-browser

```html
<link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="styles.less" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/less@4.1.1"></script>
```
